# graph_isomorphism_project
Graph Theory project

This research is conducted for college purposes, and all references to the sources that have quoted or have been used to develop my understanding of the topics are included in the "references.txt" file.

The goal of this notebook is to present information on graph isomorphism and the graph isomorphism problem in a practical and concise manner. Through brief explanations and the use of simple Python code examples, I hope to provide readers with a clear understanding of this topic.
